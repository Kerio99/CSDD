# CSDD: A Benchmark Dataset for Casting Surface Defect Detection and Segmentation

**CSDD** is a dataset designed for benchmarking casting surface defect detection and segmentation methods, with a strong focus on real-world industrial applications. It contains **2100** high-resolution images of casted metal parts, comprising a total of **56,356** manually annotated defect instances across multiple defect categories. Each image includes detailed instance-level and pixel-level annotations, with both class labels and defect regions precisely labeled by experts.
