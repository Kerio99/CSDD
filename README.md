# CSDD: A Benchmark Dataset for Casting Surface Defect Detection and Segmentation

**CSDD** is a dataset designed for benchmarking casting surface defect detection and segmentation methods, with a strong focus on real-world industrial applications. It contains **2100** high-resolution images of casted metal parts, comprising a total of **56,356** manually annotated defect instances across multiple defect categories. Each image includes detailed instance-level and pixel-level annotations, with both class labels and defect regions precisely labeled by experts.

More information can be in our paper "CSDD: A Benchmark Dataset for Casting Surface Defect Detection and Segmentation".

The dataset can be downloaded in detection format here (https:), and in segmentation format here (https:). Please feel free to contact us (kaimao@stu.xjtu.edu.cn) to request the password for accessing the download links.
